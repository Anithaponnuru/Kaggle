```{r}
#Read the data
zika = read.csv("input/cdc_zika.csv")
```

```{r}
table(zika$location)
```
Seems to be South America and parts of the US

```{r}
table(zika$report_date)
```

Looks like it's relatively recent data, being from late 2015 to very early July 2016. 

```{r}
table(zika$location_type)
```
Location type wise, it appears zika is mostly in minicipalities. There are 7 blank entries to take note of.

```{r}
table(zika$time_period)
table(zika$time_period_type)
```
Seems like the time period variables have no data.

```{r}
table(zika$unit)
```
There are 7 blank values again. The units appear to be split up into caseas and municipalities.
