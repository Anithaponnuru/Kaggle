```{r}

library(dplyr)

# Read input data
test = read_csv("input/test.csv")
train = read_csv("input/train.csv")
clients = read_csv("input/cliente_tabla.csv")
products = read_csv("input/producto_tabla.csv")
town_state = read_csv("input/town_state.csv")
```

```{r}
names(train)
names(test)
```

Train has extra columns and test is trying to determine what Demanda_uni_equil is. Will need to look into what Venta_uni_hoy, Venta_hoy, Dev_uni_proxima mean.

```{r}
head(products)
head(town_state)
head(clients)
```

These are simply the join tables to find out what hte codes are. Might be useful to extra state from town_state otherwise could probably just leave it or merge it over and convert to factor.
