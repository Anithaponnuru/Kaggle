```{r}
#Read the data
proteome = read.csv("input/77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv")
clinical_data = read.csv("input/clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv")
proteins = read.csv("input/PAM50_proteins.csv")
```

```{r}

tail(proteome)

```{r}
head(clinical_data)
```

Should match up with proteome.

```{r}
head(proteins)
```

Can match with proteome. Seems like PAM50 classification is based on RT-qPCR assay and a minimal gene set for classifying intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer.
